Project Overview:
This project represents a pioneering leap in security enhancement through the creation of an innovative real-time system that amalgamates object detection via camera and metal sensing. Designed to heighten security measures, the system seamlessly combines cutting-edge technologies to achieve optimal results.

Key Technical Aspects:
At the core of the system lies the utilization of YOLOv4, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. This robust framework enables the real-time identification of rock samples, effectively transforming the camera into an intelligent tool for recognizing objects. Moreover, a carefully synthesized integration of Buzzer and LED sensors with an Arduino Nano adds a layer of sophistication. This integration facilitates the classification of rocks based on their metallic composition, providing invaluable insights into their properties.

Impact and Benefits:
The implications of this project are far-reaching. By fusing object detection and metal sensing technologies, the system plays a pivotal role in enhancing security measures. This encompasses the proactive identification of potential hazards, contributing to the minimization of accidents and injuries. Furthermore, the system's capability to distinguish between rock types based on their metallic attributes has a direct positive impact on resource utilization. The reduction of waste and the maximization of profit underscore its effectiveness in driving operational efficiency.
